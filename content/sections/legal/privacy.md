Welcome to our privacy policy, where we promise to protect your personal information from stalkers, hackers, and the occasional nosy neighbor.

    Information We Collect

We collect information about you that we find interesting and potentially useful, such as your favorite ice cream flavor, your pet's name, and your astrological sign. We may also collect your IP address, browser type, and other technical information that we don't really understand but think sounds impressive.

    How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information to improve our services, make better jokes, and occasionally send you pictures of cute animals. We may also use your information to create personalized ads that we think you'll find hilarious, but that your mom might not appreciate.

    Information We Share

We share your personal information with our office plants, who are always looking for new friends. We may also share your information with government agencies if they ask nicely, or if we think it will help us get out of a parking ticket.

    How We Protect Your Information

We protect your personal information by wrapping it in bubble wrap and storing it in a secure location, which may or may not be under our desk. We also hire a trained ninja to guard our servers and chase away any intruders.

    Your Choices

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but we may still find ways to stalk you on social media. You can also opt-out of receiving our emails, but then you'll miss out on all the fun.

    Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy whenever we feel like it, or whenever we forget what it said. We will notify you of any changes by sending a singing telegram to your office, or by shouting it from the rooftops.
